# Pico8 Physics

This is an implementation of a constraint solver for rigid body physics in pico8/lua. This approach is based upon the Erin Catto's work on sequential impulses, see these [slides](https://box2d.org/files/ErinCatto_SequentialImpulses_GDC2006.pdf).

There are several demos included showing how to use the code.
